 * comparison would then either repeat that group or drop the rest of it. The
 * row id is the only value that is unique and stable enough to settle it.
 *
 * That id is a table-wide sequence, so a caller can read the deployment's total
 * audit volume off a cursor, and by polling can time other tenants' activity. On
 * a deployment one household runs, it says nothing the caller does not own.
 *
 * Signing or encrypting the pair with a deployment secret would close the
 * channel and keep the walk identical, and it is not done here because no such
 * secret is guaranteed to exist: ACCESS_KEY is optional, and the deployments
 * that leave it unset are exactly the shared ones where this would matter. The
 * README states the caveat rather than the mechanism pretending it away.
